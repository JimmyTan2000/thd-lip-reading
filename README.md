3.  Install `pre-commit` using the following command in the terminal:

        pip install pre-commit

4.  After it is installed, run the following command in the terminal:

        pre-commit install

5.  The formatter will be triggered everytime a git commit is initiated. If it passes the formatting test, the code will be commited. If not, the code commit will fail, and your code will be formatted to the desired format. You will then need to commit as usual again, and the test should now pass and your code should be committed.
